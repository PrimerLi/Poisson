# Poisson
Monte Carlo program for generating Poisson random numbers

The Scala file is used to generate the Poisson random numbers and the Python file is used to plot the results. Comparison is made between the Monte Carlo simulation results and the exact results. More details of the algorithm, including a mathematical proof of the validity of this algorithm, that is employed to generate the Poisson random numbers can be found here (in Chinese):
